Consistency System


# Rule 1: Minimum Daily Commitment (MDC)

1. MDC = 20 minutes/day.
2. If you do more, great. If not, 20 minutes still counts.

# Rule 2: Two-mode days

1. Green day (60–90 min): deep practice + project work

2. Amber day (20–30 min): only MDC (small exercise + notes)

This prevents “I missed one day so I quit.”

# Rule 3: Visible progress

Keep a single progress.md file in a GitHub repo and update it daily with:
 1. what you practiced
 2. what you learned
 3. 1 thing to do next
    This builds continuity and hiring proof.
